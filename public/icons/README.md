Please add your application icons to this directory.

For the Progressive Web App (PWA) to work correctly, you need to create two icon files with the exact names:

1.  `icon-192x192.png` (size: 192x192 pixels)
2.  `icon-512x512.png` (size: 512x512 pixels)

These icons will be used when a user installs your app on their home screen. You can use an online tool to generate these from a single larger image.
