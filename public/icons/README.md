# App Icons for PWA

This directory is for the icons used by the Progressive Web App (PWA) manifest. For the app to be properly installable on user devices, you need to create and place the following files in this directory:

1.  **`icon-192x192.png`**: An icon that is 192 pixels wide by 192 pixels high.
2.  **`icon-512x512.png`**: An icon that is 512 pixels wide by 512 pixels high.

These icons will be used for the home screen shortcut, the splash screen, and other system UI elements. Make sure they have a transparent background if desired.
